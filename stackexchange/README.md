# Stack Exchange userscripts
This set of userscripts is for use with Stack Exchange websites. The `mod/` directory contains scripts that I find useful while moderating; the `nonmod/` directory contains scripts that anyone can use.

These scripts are intended to be useful, but are offered as-is, and without guarantee or warranty. Scripts here may or may not work, and may break at any time due to changes in the Stack Exchange engine. Please open an issue if you find a problem, and I'll see what I can do.
